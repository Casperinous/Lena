[*] map = new MixedItemSection("map", this, 4, SortType.NONE); -> Have no items yet.

 ------> Filled by MapItem.addMap with a type of UniformListItem<MapItem>(ItemType.TYPE_MAP_LIST, items));

 |
 ------> prepare method does not seem to do anything.
 |
 |
 ------> [*] placeItems seems to place items according to the method place, implemented in OffsettedItem class.
          |  In this case, it actually writes the UniformList offset and then, it loops through every object (MapItem)
          |  of the list and sets it's offset in relation with list's offset.
          |
          |
          ---------> MapItem overrides the place0 function, thus using the offset which was set from the
                     original place method in order to set item's one.
